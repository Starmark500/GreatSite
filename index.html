        NEW DELHI: A 40-year-old man allegedly stabbed his 10-year-old son to death in Sagarpur in southwestern Delhi on Sunday after the child insisted on going out to play in the rain.
According to police, the child's father, a day laborer, had been living with his four children in a one-room house since his wife's death several years ago. The child's other siblings were present and witnessed their father stabbing their brother.
According to police, they received a call from the hospital around 1:30 p.m. saying that a child had been brought in with stab wounds, allegedly inflicted by his father. "Police officers rushed to the hospital and discovered that the boy had been brought in by his father and declared dead," a senior officer said.

the hospital, but the victim could not survive," the officer added. <pre></pre>

    <h2>India: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontpagemag.com/india-muslim-murders-16-year-old-hindu-girl-on-busy-street-in-delhi/">Muslim Murders 16-Year-Old Hindu Girl on Busy Street in Delhi</a></h2>
    <div style="text-align:left; border-top-style: double; border-color: rgb(135, 163, 215);">
    <p>On Monday morning in India, a disturbing video surfaced online and held the nation spellbound for hours. In CCTV camera footage, a man could be seen stabbing a girl repeatedly, picking up a boulder and smashing her face until he ensures that she is dead. The accused stabbed the girl 20 times with a sharp knife; at one point, the blade got stuck into her skull. Not one person in the capital city of the world’s most populous country could stop this enraged man, who committed this barbaric act in the middle of a busy lane.

The blood-curdling act took place on the night of Sunday, May 28, in Delhi’s Shahbad Dairy area. The victim was a 16-year-old Hindu minor, Sakshi, while the accused was a 20-year-old Muslim man, Sahil. Is it necessary to highlight the religions of the people involved in this crime? Yes, absolutely, and we will explain why.
<pre></pre>
Reports suggest that the two were in a “relationship.” They fought on the evening of the incident, which ended with this chilling crime committed in full public view. Police arrested the accused from Bulandshahr in the adjoining state of Uttar Pradesh.=
<pre></pre>
The accused wore a kalawa (a sacred thread worn by Hindus) on his wrist and a rudraksha necklace (again, a Hindu accessory). When the news broke, media reports only carried the man’s first name, Sahil, a name in India that does not make one’s religion clear. It was not before evening that the full name and identity of the accused were made public and included in the media reports. Even the Chief Minister of the national capital avoided referencing the accused’s identity in his tweet. Clearly, the accused had tried to present himself as a Hindu, and the “secular” institutions of the country tried their best to hide his religious affiliation.
<pre></pre>
A popular narrative about India’s current social and political situation is that Muslims are being victimized in this majoritarian state. Had there been an ounce of truth in these sinister claims, would a Muslim man have the nerve to kill a Hindu minor girl in the middle of a busy street?
<pre></pre>
For 75 years, the Indian government has handled the Muslim community with kid gloves in secular India. Politicians have showered them with rights and perks no other minorities got. This leniency eventually led to the rise of Islamic jihadists and supremacists in the country.
<pre></pre>
These fanatical Muslims know that they can get away with any crime, and that a brigade of apologists for Islam disguised as intellectuals will stand up in their defense. These “intellectuals” present themselves as journalists, columnists promulgating fake narratives of Muslim victimhood in India on international platforms, radio jockeys, actors, writers, historians, and even judiciary members. Politicians throw themselves at their feet because they vote as a bloc, unlike the fragmented Hindu community.
<pre></pre>
Indian politicians have awarded Mohammad Afroz, one of the most brutal rapists in India’s history, with cash, sewing machines and a new identity so that he can start a new life. This rapist killed his victim by inserting a rod in his victim’s genitals and pulling out her intestines. Today, he works as a cook in some households, perhaps with young girls.
<pre></pre>
In 2022, a Supreme Court judge cancelled the death sentence of Mohhamad Firoz, who had been convicted of rape and murder. The high court scrapped the 2014 judgment passed by the Madhya Pradesh High Court, quoting British novelist Oscar Wilde’s axiom, “every sinner has a future.” Firoz was convicted for the rape and murder of a four-year-old girl. What future could he have, and how safe would his existence make the future of an average Indian child playing at a park?
<pre></pre>
In November 2022, Delhi police arrested 28-year-old Aftab Amin Poonawallah for the gruesome murder of his Hindu live-in partner, Shraddha Walker. Aftab had allegedly killed her in May, chopped her into pieces and stored her in his refrigerator for months. When this story broke, the usual apologists rushed to contradict his religious affiliation by claiming he was a Parsi. These claims didn’t last long, as during the polygraph test, the accused confessed: “No regret even if hanged, will get hoors in Jannat.”
<pre></pre>
Accused in the recent case, Sahil Khan also admits that he has “No regrets.” These cold-blooded jihadis have perfected the art of slaughter and never have any regret for the monstrous crimes they commit. Between the murder of Shraddha in May 2022 and Sakshi in May 2023, there have been numerous other killings of Hindu girls at the hands of their Muslim friends, lover or husband. Some make it to the headlines; others are shoved under the rug so as to protect those who share the religious affiliations of these murderers.
<pre></pre>
When one tries to discuss these incidents, term them “Love Jihad,” make informative movies to educate young girls, the Islamic lobby in India leaps to dismiss their efforts as propaganda against the ever-so-hapless Indian minority. They work to further this narrative tirelessly, until the next Hindu girl is found lying dead in a pool of her own blood on a random Indian street.</p>
